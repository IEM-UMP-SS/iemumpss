  On 17 May, I had a great opportunity to participate in a site visit at UPC Chemicals, Gebeng during the IEM-UMPSA Engineering Week 2024, which provided a comprehensive understanding of how <strong>Plasticizers</strong> and <strong>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)</strong> production works in the chemical manufacturing industry.

<br />

<p className="text-lg">
  Here are some highlights and key takeaways from the site visit:
</p>

<br />

<ol className="text-lg">
  <li><strong>1. Enhanced Knowledge üí°</strong> The event began with an opening speech by Plant Manager, Mr. Wan Mohd Nazrul Wan Ismail, followed by a comprehensive business introduction of UPC Group and UPC Malaysia by Sales Representative, Mr. Derrick Chen. These sessions provided an insightful overview of Plasticizers and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) production, covering key aspects such as the chemical business landscape, product supply chains, overall process flow, and detailed process descriptions. This knowledge deepened our understanding of the industry and its operations.</li> <br/>
  <li><strong>2. Safety First ‚õë</strong> The safety briefing by EHS Manager, Mr. Mohd Nazrul Izani Mohamed Nasir highlights the critical importance of <strong>industrial safety</strong> and the strict rules and regulations that must be followed in chemical manufacturing environments. We gained a firsthand understanding of the safety requirements necessary to enter the plant, emphasizing the need for full compliance with safety protocols and the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</li> <br/>
  <li><strong>3. Industrial Exposure üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</strong> We had the invaluable opportunity to immerse ourselves in an industrial environment through a comprehensive site visit. Special thanks to Aubriecia Lim for the detailed explanations throughout the tour. We explored key areas such as the process area, DCS control room, utilities, lab, and wastewater treatment facility. This experience allowed us to recap our academic knowledge with real-world applications, providing deeper insights and significant benefits for our final-year <strong>plant design project</strong>.</li>

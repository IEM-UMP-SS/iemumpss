<p className="text-lg">
    I have always been passionate about programming. I learned programming online through platforms like freeCodeCamp and CS50. My web development journey started with basic HTML and CSS. As I gained more experience, I explored frameworks like Angular and then React. Now, I primarily use <a href="https://nextjs.org/" className="underline text-blue-500" >Next.js</a>.
</p>

<br />

<p className="text-lg">
    This website is built using Next.js and Supabase, providing a seamless and efficient experience for our users.

    To all new coders and IEM members, here are some pieces of advice about programming and future paths:
</p>

<br />

    <ol className="text-lg">
        <li>1. **Start with the Basics**: Understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is crucial. These form the foundation of web development.</li> 
        <li>2. **Explore Frameworks**: Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore popular frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. They help in building complex applications efficiently.</li>
        <li>3. **Keep Learning**: The tech field is always evolving. Stay updated with the latest technologies and trends. Continuous learning is key.</li>
        <li>4. **Build Projects**: Apply what you learn by building projects. This not only reinforces your knowledge but also creates a portfolio that showcases your skills.</li>
        <li>5. **Join Communities**: Being part of tech communities, like <a href="https://t.me/+NcP39ZKM1nI2NDJl" className="underline text-blue-500" >IEM UMPSA Developer</a>, can provide support, networking opportunities, and collaboration on projects.</li>
        <li>6. **Seek Feedback**: Don't hesitate to ask for feedback on your code. Constructive criticism helps you grow and improve.</li>
        <li>7. **Professionalism**: Strive to be professional in your work and interactions. Embark on professionalism, as our slogan emphasizes. This includes writing clean code, meeting deadlines, and communicating effectively.</li>
    </ol>

<br />

<p className="text-lg">
    Remember, the journey of programming is continuous and ever-evolving. Stay curious, keep coding, and embrace the challenges along the way. Your efforts will lead to a fulfilling career and contributions to the tech community.
